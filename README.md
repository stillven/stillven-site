**A research project asking one narrow question: can a system govern its own execution well enough to make a measurable, repeatable difference — and actually prove it?**

Stillven is in active validation. The implementation, datasets, and experimental modules live in private repositories while the architecture is tested against its own success criteria. This page is the only public surface, and it stays deliberately thin until the results earn more.

## The Question
Modern operating systems balance responsiveness, throughput, efficiency, and fairness across everything running at once. Under load, the application you actually care about quietly competes with everything you don't — and the cost tends to show up as *inconsistency*, not raw slowness.

Most "optimizers" answer this with static tweaks, blunt cleanups, and confident claims. Almost none of them measure whether any of it actually helped.

## The Principle
> Execution should be governed by validation, not guesswork.

Stillven doesn't "boost" or "clean." It treats every action as a hypothesis — predicted before it runs, measured after, and kept only when the outcome holds up under real use. The bar isn't whether an intervention *sounds* right; it's whether the evidence says it worked, repeatably — that it can be shown, per run, without overclaiming, and that it survives independent adversarial review before it's ever trusted to act on its own.

## What's Public, and What Isn't
The method is the project; the mechanisms aren't on display. Source, telemetry schemas, and results stay private during validation — partly to protect the work, mostly because unvalidated claims aren't worth publishing. Public documentation expands only as internal milestones clear their gates.
